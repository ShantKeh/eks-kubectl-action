# eks-kubectl
This is a fork of https://github.com/ianbelcher/eks-kubectl-action

Access your EKS cluster via `kubectl` in a Github Action. No fuss, no messing around with special
kubeconfigs, just ensure you have `eks:ListCluster` and `eks:DescribeCluster` rights on your
user.

See [this great blog post](https://prabhatsharma.in/blog/amazon-eks-iam-authentication-how-to-add-an-iam-user/)
for an overview if you're using a new IAM user.

## Example configuration

You just need to supply your cluster's name. This action offloads aws credential management to the aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials action which should be ran prior to this step. This action will pick up the secrets generated by the configure-aws-credentials action.

```yaml
jobs:
  jobName:
    name: Update deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
    steps:
      # --- #
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@master
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_GITHUB_ROLE }}
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
          
      - name: Build and push CONTAINER_NAME
        uses: shantkeh/eks-kubectl-action@master
        with:
          cluster_name: ${{ secrets.CLUSTER_NAME }}
          args: set image --record deployment/pod-name pod-name=${{ steps.build.outputs.IMAGE_URL }}
      # --- #
```
